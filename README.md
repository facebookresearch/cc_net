## Installation

We only tried this on Linux but installation should be possible on MacOS too.

To install prerequisites on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake libeigen3-dev liblzma-dev unzip python3.7`

1. Create or simlink a `data` folder to where you want to download the corpus.

2. Run `make install`. This will download some resources and install required packages.

3. If you have a C++ 17 compiler you can also run
`pip install .[getpy]`, it provides more memory efficient hashset.

4. Install the following tools manually if `make install` failed:
- `lmplz` and `build_binary` from [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm)
- `spm_train` and `spm_encode` from [Sentence Piece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)

## Training Language Models

The `Makefile` is used to train Sentence Piece and LM on Wikipedia data.

* `make help` shows help
* `make lang=de lm` trains a Sentence Piece and a LM on German Wikipedia
* `make all_lm` trains the same model than in the paper
* `make lang=de dl_lm` downloads the LM trained for the paper
* `make dl_all_lm` downloads all of them

## Pipeline overview

The full mining pipeline is divided in 3 steps:

- `hashes` downloads one Common-Crawl snapshot, and compute hashes for each paragraph
- `mine` removes duplicates, detects language, run the LM and split by lang/perplexity buckets
- `regroup` regroup the files created by `mine` in chunks of 4Gb

Each step needs the previous step to be over before starting.
You can launch the full pipeline using `python -m cc_net`.

* `python -m cc_net --help` shows help
* `python -m cc_net --dump 2019-13` treats a specific snapshot
* `python -m cc_net -l my -l gu` 
restricts to specific languages
* `python -m cc_net --lm_dir my_lms/` uses custom LMs
* `python -m cc_net --lang_threshold 0.3` set a specific field in `mine.Config`
* `python -m cc_net --config test` runs on a tiny subset of a snapshot
* `python -m cc_net --config config/my_config.json` uses configuration from the given config file

## Reproducing our work

Given the CPU required to run the full pipeline on such a big corpus we share a mapping from url to the information we computed.
You can reconstruct the corpus used in the paper by using:

```sh
python -m cc_net --conf reproduce --dump 2019-09
```

## Extract XLM-R data

[Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale (XLM-RoBERTa)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02116.pdf)
paper was trained on data extracted by an internal version of cc_net.

Due to the format being a little bit different please use the following command instead:

```sh
python cc_net/tools/dl_cc_100.py --help
python cc_net/tools/dl_cc_100.py --outdir data_cc100 --process 8
```

If you use this version of the data please also consider citing:

## Adapting to your infrastructure

Given the computation cost of running the full pipeline we distributed the computation
on a [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) cluster using [submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit).
`submitit` will default to spawning processes on your machine if Slurm cluster is found.
You should tweak `--task_parallelism` to something adapated to your machine.
Defaults are 512 for mining and 20 for reproducing.

To run the tasks in-process use `--execution debug`.


## Output format

Generated files are compressed JSON files. There is one JSON object per line.

__List of fields__:

- digest: sha1 digest of the webpage (part of CC)
- length: number of chars
- nlines: number of lines
- source_domain: web domain of the webpage
- title: page title (part of CC)
- raw_content: webpage content after deduplication
- original_nlines: number of lines before deduplication
- original_length: number of chars before deduplication
- language: language detected by FastText LID
- language_score: language score
- perplexity: perplexity of a LM trained on Wikipedia

He had many friends through church and the Knights of Columbus. He was a meticulous handyman, and enjoyed building and fixing things and restoring antique furniture to perfection. He was a fan and supported his Colorado Rockies and Denver Broncos.

You can peak at those files using UNIX tools `zcat` and [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), eg:
`zcat data/mined/2019-09/en_head_0000.json.gz | head -1 | jq .`

`jq` can do some complicated filtering.
`jsonql.py` provides a Python API with multiprocess support to do more complicated operations like LM scoring of the document.
