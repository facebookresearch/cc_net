## Installation

We only tried this on Linux but installation should be possible on MacOS too.

To install prerequisites on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev cmake libeigen3-dev liblzma-dev unzip python3.7`

1. Create or simlink a `data` folder to where you want to download the corpus.

2. Run `make install`. This will download some resources and install required packages.

3. If you have a C++ 17 compiler you can also run
`pip install .[getpy]`, it provides more memory efficient hashset.

4. Install the following tools manually if `make install` failed:
- `lmplz` and `build_binary` from [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm)
- `spm_train` and `spm_encode` from [Sentence Piece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)

## Training Language Models

The `Makefile` is used to train Sentence Piece and LM on Wikipedia data.

* `make help` shows help
* `make lang=de lm` trains a Sentence Piece and a LM on German Wikipedia
* `make all_lm` trains the same model than in the paper
* `make lang=de dl_lm` downloads the LM trained for the paper
* `make dl_all_lm` downloads all of them

## Pipeline overview

The full mining pipeline is divided in 3 steps:

- `hashes` downloads one Common-Crawl snapshot, and compute hashes for each paragraph
- `mine` removes duplicates, detects language, run the LM and split by lang/perplexity buckets
- `regroup` regroup the files created by `mine` in chunks of 4Gb

Each step needs the previous step to be over before starting.
You can launch the full pipeline using `python -m cc_net mine`.

* `python -m cc_net mine --help` shows help
* `python -m cc_net mine --dump 2019-13` downloads a specific snapshot
* `python -m cc_net mine -l my -l gu` 
restricts to specific languages
* `python -m cc_net mine --lm_dir my_lms/` uses custom LMs
* `python -m cc_net mine --lang_threshold 0.3` set a specific field in `mine.Config`
* `python -m cc_net mine --config test` runs on a tiny subset of a snapshot
* `python -m cc_net mine --config config/my_config.json` uses configuration from the given config file

## Reproducing our work

Given the CPU required to run the full pipeline on such a big corpus we share a mapping from url to the information we computed.
You can reconstruct the corpus used in the paper by using:

```sh
python -m cc_net reproduce --dump 2019-09
```

## Adapting to your infrastructure

Given the computation cost of running the full pipeline we distributes the computation on a SLURM cluster using the private submitit package.
`execution.py` also contains code to run the code using `multiprocessing` library by passing `--execution mp` to commands.
To run the tasks in-process use `--execution debug`.


## Output format

Generated files are compressed JSON files. There is one JSON object per line.

__List of fields__:

- url: webpage URL (part of CC)
- date_download: date of download (part of CC)
- digest: sha1 digest of the webpage (part of CC)
- length: number of chars
- nlines: number of lines
- source_domain: web domain of the webpage
- title: page title (part of CC)
- raw_content: webpage content after deduplication (part of CC)
- original_nlines: number of lines before deduplication
- original_length: number of chars before deduplication
- language: language detected by FastText LID
- language_score: language score
- perplexity: perplexity of a LM trained on Wikipedia

__Sample JSON object__:

He loved spending time with family camping, fishing, hunting, boating and just hanging out.\nHis Catholic faith was extremely important to him as he gave of his time and talents to the community. He had many friends through church and the Knights of Columbus. He was a meticulous handyman, and enjoyed building and fixing things and restoring antique furniture to perfection. He was a fan and supported his Colorado Rockies and Denver Broncos. Throughout the years he had devoted four-legged friends (his dogs and a horse named Sunny Boy).\nWe have many cherished memories of him that we will treasure until we are with him again.\n~ Family of LeeRoy F.

You can peak at those files using UNIX tools `zcat` and [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), eg:
`zcat data/regroup/2019-09/en_head_0000.json.gz | head -1 | jq .`

`jq` can do some complicated filtering.
`jsonql.py` provides a Python API with multiprocess support to do more complicated operations like LM scoring of the document.
